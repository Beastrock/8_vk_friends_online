## two ways of writing get_friends_online_list function
There are two ways of getting online friends by VK API. The first way is to call get.friends.getOnline() for getting friends IDs and then pass it to get.users() method which give us info from user ID arguments.    

    def get_friends_online_list(login, password):
        session = vk.AuthSession(
            app_id=APP_ID,
            user_login=login,
            user_password=password,
            scope="friends"
        )
        api = vk.API(session)
        online_friends_ids = api.friends.getOnline()
        return api.users.get(user_ids=online_friends_ids) 

Second way is call only one API method get.users with parametres = "online". Comparing from the first way it allows **to order friends list** by name with order = "name" parameter, which is more convenient, but it has online-checking function.

    def get_all_friends_info(login, password):
        session = vk.AuthSession(
            app_id=APP_ID,
            user_login=login,
            user_password=password,
        )
        api = vk.API(session)
        return api.friends.get(fields="online", order="name")
    
    
    def get_online_friends_list(all_friends_info):
        return [friend for friend in all_friends_info if friend["online"] == 1]
   
It was choosen to write it in a second way as there aren't any additional conditions in the task on devman.org.
